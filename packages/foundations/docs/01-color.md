# Color

```js script
export default {
  title: 'Foundations/Color',
};
```

Chi colors are designed to comply with U.S. [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) federal requirements. Section 508 follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)) Level AA standards which require text and background color contrast ratios of 4.5:1 or higher. All Chi colors either meet (AA) or exceed (AAA) these standards and have been marked below accordingly.
